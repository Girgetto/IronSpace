Tutorial 
--------
```
W move forward
A turn left
D turn right
```

The game's goal is to direct the spaceship 🚀 to the target (the Ironhack logo) without hitting the planets, but be careful! , the movements can be modified by the gravitational force of the planets themselves, [have fun](https://girgetto.github.io/IronSpace/index.html) 😁
